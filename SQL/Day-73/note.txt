    - View is a virtual table that does not store any data on its own but presents a customized view of one or more tables in a database
    - Virtual table physically not exist in memory

    - Simple Views - Created from 1 single table

# Ex - 01

SELECT * FROM flights;

CREATE VIEW indigo AS 
SELECT * FROM flights
WHERE Airline = 'Indigo';

SELECT * FROM indigo

# Ex-02  

CREATE VIEW join_order_data AS 
SELECT order_id, amount, r_name, name, date, delivery_time, delivery_rating, restaurant_rating 
FROM orders t1
JOIN users t2 ON t1.user_id = t2.user_id
JOIN restaurants t3 ON t1.r_id = t3.r_id

SELECT r_name, MONTHNAME(date), SUM(amount) FROM join_order_data
GROUP BY r_name

    - Complex Views - Created from multiple tables with the help of joins, subquery etc.


    -- Read only Vs Updatable Views --

    - Read-only views: cannot be updated. They are used to simplify the process of querying data, but they cannot be used to modify or delete data in the underlying tables.

    - Updatable views: Updatable views are views that allow you to modify, insert or delete data in the underlying tables through the view. They behave like normal tables, but with restrictions.
        - if i change anything in view original table will be changed

    -- Materialized Views -- (* * *)
        - store the result of query
        - Views not help to reduce execution time but Materialized View reduce execution time
