~ Database usages
    - Data storage
    - Data analysis
    - Record keeping
    - Web application

~ Properties of an ideal databases:
    1. Integrity (Accuracy + Consistency)
    2. Availability (24/7 runtime)
    3. Security 
    4. Independent of application 
    5. Concurrency (Parallel use -> at the same time give all request response)

~ Different types of databases
    1. Relational / RDBMS / SQL -> organize data into table with rows and columns
    2. NoSql / MongoDB -> designed to handle large amount of unstructured or semi-structured data such as documents, images, videos
    3. Column -> store data in column rather than rows
    4. Graph -> used to store and query graph structured data such as recommendation system
    5. Key-Value -> store data as a collection of keys and values

~ In relational database
    - column -> attribute / fields
    - no. of column -> degree (number of col 5 = degree 5)
    - row -> tuples / records
    - no. of rows -> cardinality (number of row 4 = cardinality 4)
    - missing value -> null 

~ DBMS (Database Management Program)
    - To run any database need a software which in known as DBMS (DBMS management guy who control database)
    - data store in hardware (HDD / SSD) for that if i want to control it we need operating system

~ Function of DBMS
    - Data management
    - Control Integrity (Maintain accuracy of data)
    - Concurrency (simultaneous data access from multiple users)
    - Transaction (if transaction fail it will automatically return)
    - Security
    - Utility
